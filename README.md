# Burger Builder App using ReactJS

App in which you can add and delete the items you want in your burger. This app is a part of Udemy course which I am learning. Feel free to look at the code. 

## Instructions

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies on your local machine.
Use `npm run start` to launch the app. Then go to http://localhost:3000/ , which is default port for react applications.
